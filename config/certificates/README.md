# Sample certificates for testing only

The sample certificates in this folder will be automatically made available to the Docker-Containers by a mount and are pre-configured in the .env file.  
:point_right:  It's stringly recommended that you use your own certificates and keys as the __certificates & keys are public on GitHub__. 

Place you own certificates and keys in this directory and adjust the .env file accordingly. It's important that you are using different filenames, as the original files will be 
replaced with the next version.
